## Installation

In your pubspec.yaml file within your Flutter Project add modern_player under
dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  modern_player: <latest_version>
```

## Instalation from flutter_vlc_player

### iOS

If you're unable to view media loaded from an external source, you should also
add the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```

For more information, or for more granular control over your App Transport
Security (ATS) restrictions, you should
[read Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nsapptransportsecurity/nsallowsarbitraryloads).

Make sure that following line in `<project root>/ios/Podfile` uncommented:

`platform :ios, '9.0'`

> NOTE: While the Flutter `video_player` is not functional on iOS Simulators,
> this package (`flutter_vlc_player`) **is** fully functional on iOS simulators.

To enable vlc cast functionality for external displays (chromecast), you should
also add the following:

```xml
<key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
<string>Used to search for chromecast devices</string>
<key>NSBonjourServices</key>
<array>
  <string>_googlecast._tcp</string>
</array>
```

<hr>

### Android

To load media/subitle from an internet source, your app will need the `INTERNET`
permission.\
This is done by ensuring your
`<project root>/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file contains a
`uses-permission` declaration for `android.permission.INTERNET`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

As Flutter includes this permission by default, the permission is likely already
declared in the file.

Note that if you got "Cleartext HTTP traffic to \* is not permitted" you need to
add the `android:usesClearTextTraffic="true"` flag in the AndroidManifest.xml
file, or define a new "Network Security Configuration" file. For more
information, check
https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config

<br>

In order to load media/subtitle from internal device storage, you should put the
storage permissions as follows:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

In some cases you also need to add the
`android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true"` flag to the Application tag in
AndroidManifest.xml file.

After that you can access the media/subtitle file by

    "/storage/emulated/0/{FilePath}"
    "/sdcard/{FilePath}"

<hr>

#### Android build configuration

1. In `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    packagingOptions {
       // Fixes duplicate libraries build issue,
       // when your project uses more than one plugin that depend on C++ libs.
        pickFirst 'lib/**/libc++_shared.so'
    }

   buildTypes {
      release {
         minifyEnabled true
         proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile(
                 'proguard-android-optimize.txt'),
                 'proguard-rules.pro'
      }
   }
}
```

2. Create `android/app/proguard-rules.pro`, add the following lines:

```proguard
-keep class org.videolan.libvlc.** { *; }
```

<hr>

#### Android multi-window support

To enable multi-window support in your Android application, you need to make
changes to `AndroidManifest.xml`, add the `android:resizeableActivity` key for
the main activity, as well as the `android.allow_multiple_resumed_activities`
metadata for application:

```xml
<manifest ...>
  <application ...>
    <activity ...
      android:resizeableActivity="true">
      ...
    </activity>
    ...
    <meta-data
      android:name="android.allow_multiple_resumed_activities"
      android:value="true" />
  </application>
</manifest>
```
